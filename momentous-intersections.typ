    This article is a philosophical and admittedly subjective attempt (drawing on the author's life experience) to discern general features of the Russian and Jewish national character and their interaction in the twentieth century. Several common traits of Jewish and Russian spirituality (or religious psychology) and national identity are discussed. These include messianic strivings and the belief in being God's chosen people, which simultaneously unify and divide both nations; a tendency to utopian thinking; adherence to the ideals of social equality and justice; a feeling for the national element with which personality becomes merged and thereby finds itself; a tendency to wandering, to rootlessness, and to nomadism; universalism and the easy assimilation of cultural customs; and centuries-long experience of suffering and persecution. The author's reflections on Jewish and Russian national and spiritual identity draw on a broad range of writers, including Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Vladimir Solovyov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Nikolai Berdyaev, Vasily Rozanov, Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak, and Gershom Sholem.],

<a-draft-of-a-human>
How can one write about nations from the lofty spiritual vantage point
required to understand them without succumbing to the worst vices of
nationalism or to intellectual self-indulgence? These jottings are
written neither from the perspective of the scholar nor of the
historian, but are rather in the nature of philosophical essay, being a
subjective attempt to discern general features of the Russian and Jewish
characters and of their interaction in the twentieth century. To
paraphrase Mandelstam, I should define the genre of the present
contribution as \"the murmur of my experience.\"

If I could sum up my sense of Jewishness in a single word, it would be
\"vibration.\" As Mandelstam wrote about Solomon Mikhoels: \"The entire
strength of Judaism, the entire rhythm of dancing abstract thought, all
the pride of the dance, the sole stimulus for which, in the last
analysis, is the feeling of compassion for the Earthall of this turns
into quivering of the hands, into the vibration of thinking fingers,
which are imbued with spirit, like articulate speech.\"#footnote[Osip
Mandelstam, \"Mikhoels,\" #emph[Collected Works];, 3 vols. (New York:
Mezhdunarodnoe literaturnoe sodruzhestvo, 1969), 108.]

Mandelstam's observation is not merely physiognomic, but is also
metaphysical, and is well in accord with the central image of his octave
(see the epigraph): \"the tremor of Judaic concerns.\" Judaism's
\"concerns\" (in all the manifold meanings of that word pertaining to
relations with the Divine and one's fellow human beings) are
\"tremors,\" both in the literal sense of \"tremblings,\" but also
\"quiverings,\" the \"vacillations\" between constantly reappraised
possibilities, between flight into the future and return to the present,
the constant need to revise the life's course that has been roughly
mapped out, to redraw it and re-plan it. This metaphor of Judaism's
\"concerns\" arises in the context of shifting sands, the quaking,
crumbling flesh of the earth, which imparts the same \"tremor\" of lines
in headlong flightfor the draughtsman of the Jewish desert is the wind,
probably the most \"tremulous\" of all draughtsmen. If Mandelstam's
sketch of Mikhoels offers us a #emph[portrait] of vibration, then his
octave portrays its #emph[landscape];. The quiver of hands and the
\"thinking fingers\" correspond to the \"shifting sands.\" The same
image recurs in the line, \"He moulds his experience from murmur.\" For
a \"murmur\" is a quivering of the lips, of halting speech, a
preliminary attempt at articulating sound and sense. Indeed, the word
\"experience\" is etymologically related to \"experiment,\" a meaning
also relevant here, in the sense of an \"essay\"/\"assay,\" a \"trial,\"
a vacillatingly hypothetical orientation towards the world. In the
original Russian, all of these words#emph[za#strong[bot];a] \[concern\],
#emph[o#strong[pyt];] \[experiment/experience\], #emph[tre#strong[pet];]
\[tremor/quiver\], #emph[le#strong[pet];] \[murmur\]not only have
acoustic correspondences, but also evince correspondences in meaning, in
that they convey the oscillations of the soul and the body, of thoughts
and speech. … Mandelstam discovered the unique images and words to
represent Jewishness as vibration, both phonetically and semantically.

The fundament of Jewish spiritual life trembles, quakes, as if animated
by continuing volcanic activity under the surface of the earth. The
constant quaking, quivering, or rather, tremulousness of the Jewish
sense of life finds its most forceful expression, in my view, in the
poetry of Afanasy Fet and Boris Pasternak. It is all the more authentic
for being unconscious, as neither acknowledged their Jewishnessindeed,
they shunned it. \"Trembling\" and \"quivering\" were the epithets that
Fet most frequently applied to natural phenomena. \"The moon shines
tremulously\" (\"#emph[Tikhaia, zvezdnaia noch] …\"), the \"ardent
light\" of sun \"plays quiveringly on the leaves\" (\"#emph[Ia prishel k
tebe s privetom] …\"), \"the chorus of stars quivers\" (\"#emph[Na stoge
sena] …\"), \"the leaves and stars quiver\" (\"#emph[Solovei i roza];\"),
\"everything quivers and sings in spite of itself\" (\"#emph[Chto za
vecher] …\"). In this general tremor of life, the lyrical persona joins,
every fibre of his being a-quiver: \"I hear the beating of my heart and
the quiver of my hands and feet\" (\"#emph[Ia zhdu … Solovinoe ekho]
…\")

The most characteristic state of the Pasternakian hero is precisely the
same kind of quivering, as if his soul is becoming a single tremulous
spark: \"I shuddered. I blazed up and was extinguished. …\"
(\"Marburg\"). \"I would break open verse, like a garden, with all the
quiver of veins …\" (\"#emph[Vo vsem mne khochetsia doiti] …\"),
\"Nature, the world, a universal hiding place / I will remain steadfast
in your long service / held fast in a secret trembling / In tears of
happiness\" (\"#emph[Kogda razguliaetsia];\"). The state of being imbued
with the utmost plenitude of life extends even to nature: \"The very
nightingales would roll their eyes with a shudder. …\"
(\"#emph[Osen];\"). This quivering is the sparking of the spirit through
every particle of the universe, its flight and return as the incessant
flickering of life, of its possibilities that flare up and die out.

This quivering betrays the Jew's dependence on his Creator, his Jewish
\"fear and trembling.\" Kierkegaard's #emph[Fear and Trembling];, the
#emph[fons et origo] of European existentialism, is in essence a
depiction of Abraham, a proto-Jew. He converses, with trembling hands,
and thinks, his thoughts a-tremble. Europeans and Americans keep face,
they do not crumble under pressure, the contours of their physiognomy do
not fragment, but are drawn clearly, as if with a ruler. It seems to me
that Jews are set apart by the frequency and amplitude of their
waverings and of their psychic impulses. A Jew constantly thinks and
re-thinks his thoughts, feels and re-feels his feelings. On this
account, he can make an impression of psychomotoric \"tremulousness,\"
bustling and pottering about, or in Saltykov-Shchedrin's phrase, \"of
hare-like hastiness, which prevents a Jew from sitting still for a
moment.\"#footnote[Saltykov-Shchedrin, \"July Breeze\" (\"#emph[Iulskoe
veianie];\"), 1882. This satiric essay is one of the strongest
statements by Russian writers of the 19th century in defense of Jews.
#link("https://lechaim.ru/ARHIV/87/salt.htm");] But this is only on the
surface. This \"hastiness\" uproots a Jew from the soil of reality and
bears him off into the realm of vacillating contours, where reality
consists entirely of glinting possibilities. This accounts for the
success of Jews in trade, in financial dealings, on the stock-market,
where one passes from the natural relations of the tangible world into
the realm of possibilities, of vaulting magnitudes, of symbolic
relations, where interpretations remain in flux. The Jews are the people
of the Book, and not of nature; and the book, moreover, in contrast to
nature, is a world of possibilitiesunrestricted and volatile, which can
never be entirely realised. For the Jew, reality is only still in the
process of creation, remaining a thrilling possibility, constantly being
corrected and remade, now being underlined, now being crossed out. The
Jew is an unfinished sketch, a #emph[draft of a man];; he is nowhere to
be found, his place is unoccupiedhe is merely a possibility.

I was once told about a French art collector who attended an exhibition
of work by Chaim Sutin and other Jewish artists and summarised his
impressions thus: \"not a single smooth line.\" It is known that Walter
Benjamin, a major twentieth-century German-Jewish thinker, \"did not
like round numbers and straight lines. When observing the world around
him, he found nothing straight in it: straight lines only existed in
philosophy, whose predisposition not to notice crookedness and
fragmentariness, to ignore discontinuities and conceal voids he tried to
resist\" (Denis Sobolev).#footnote[Denis Sobolev, #emph[Evrei i Evropa]
(2008), ch.19: \"Walter Benjamin: mezhdu iazykom i istoriei.\"
#link("https://www.e-reading.co.uk/chapter.php/1004520/47/denis-sobolev-evrei-i-evropa.html");.]
Finally, the most famous Jewish person of the twentieth century, Albert
Einstein, is renowned for having discovered the curvature of time and
space.

The word \"Jew\" has the unusual quality of combining with the names of
other nations. Jews can be Russian, German, Polish, American, even
Chinese and Egyptian, without ceasing to be Jews. Jews are always a
\"dual\" nation: its designation requires another epithet, and sometimes
even two, as in \"American-Russian Jew.\" Only in the last sixty years
has there been the Jew-as-such, although they are also called \"Israeli
Jews,\" as if there were a suspicion that \"Jewish\" and \"Israeli\"
could not be one and the same thing but were rather a variety of dual
national allegiances. To be a Jew always means to be someone else. The
Jew is always more himself as a Jew: it is as if his essence acquires a
\"mark-up,\" the price for which is estrangement from his own roots.

Thus, the Jew is easily assimilated into other nations and can be
transplanted into the soil of other cultures. This is not the grafting
of one reality onto another, but the grafting of possibilities onto
reality. This assimilation is simultaneously a problematisation. The
Jews introduce into other cultures the realm of other possibilities,
like a question and a hypothesis introduced into the circle of
established realities. I am reminded of the little linguistic anecdote:
\"Why does a Jew always answer a question with another question?But why
not?\" The point is not the separately posed \"Jewish question,\" but
rather the fact that Jewishness is itself a question, posed to itself
and to others. The question is not only about Jewishness as such, but
also about the foundations of the life of other nations, their beliefs,
persuasions, institutions, and their social and cultural establishments.
Thus, in his marvellous article, Vladimir Solovyov substituted for the
stereotypical phrase \"the Jewish question\" a much better one\"Jewry
and the Christian Question\"; and Dmitry Merezhkovsky subsequently
entitled one of his articles, \"The Jewish Question as a Russian
Question.\"#footnote[See Solovyov, \"Jewry and the Christian Question\"
(1884), in Vladimir Solovyov, #emph[The Burning Bush: Writings on Jews
and Judaism];, ed., trans., and with commentary by Gregory Yuri Glazov
(Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2016), 277; and Dmitry
Merezhkovsky, \"The Jewish Question as a Russian Question\" (1916), in
#emph[A Revolution of the Spirit: Crisis of Value in Russia, 1890];,
ed.~Bernice Glatzre Rosenthal and Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak, trans.
Marion Schwartz (New York: Fordham University Press, 1990), 222.] In
their relations with other nations, Jewry simultaneously casts doubt on
both them and itself, so that everything shifts and a new day of
creation dawns. The Jewish question arises everywhere simultaneously
with Russian, German, Arab questionsand also simultaneously with a host
of other questions in science, literature, music, politics, philosophy,
religion. … The Jews are like inquisitive children still at the age when
they persistently raise questions about \"hows\" and \"whys,\"
spontaneously asking about matters that seem self-evident and settled
for \"adults.\" It is no accident that the very word \"Jew\" in its
etymological derivation from Hebrew means \"from another or from the
opposing side,\" \"not of these parts.\" This affords the possibility of
seeing the world as strange, of being surprised by the most generally
accepted truths and deeply rooted customs, and of problematising the
existence of other nations and of mankind as a whole.

\" … The Jew is the spirit of negation, a protest against the dogmas of
creeds …,\"remarked the American rabbi Isaac Wise.#footnote[Isaac M.
Wise, #emph[Selected Writings of Isaac M. Wise];. With a Biography by
the editors David Philipson and Louis Grossmann (Cincinnati, OH: The
Robert Clarke Company, 1900), 182.
#link("https://collections.americanjewisharchives.org/wise/attachment/5307/IMWise_selected_writings.pdf");]
Eric Fromm and Martin Buber ascribed to a similar view: the Jews are
ostensibly staunch iconoclasts but are not as renowned for creation. But
a question only signifies negation and revolutionary overthrow in its
most primitive forms; in its essence, a question is a summons to create.
In the words of Ernest Renan, \"the true Israelite is a man who is
tormented by dissatisfaction, in the grip of an unquenchable thirst for
the future.\"#footnote[Quoted in Nikolai Berdyaev, #emph[Smysl istorii.
Opyt filosofii chelovecheskoi sud′by];, 2#super[nd] ed.~(Paris: YMCA
Press, 1969), 119] From the Jews emanate waves of probabilities from
which the world is made, accomplishing one thing, discarding anotherthey
have not yet been fashioned into a smooth line of things in existence.
The Jew is himself a process of taking decisions about the world, a
process in which there is also a place of for indecisiveness and
vacillation. The Jew senses within himself the constant pulsation of
God's free will, poised between the multiplicity of possible
world-orders rather than choosing one alone. The Jew is like a
fontanelle in the cranium of humanity, the incompleteness of all
contours of personality and history. The Jew is a lump of primordial
clay: man is still being moulded from it, it is still being squeezed and
kneaded in the hands of the living God. In the Jew, reality is still
fermenting and being raised by the yeast of the possible.

In a famous speech, the Renaissance thinker Giovanni Pico della
Mirandola spoke thus of the dignity of man: \"God took man as the
creation of an indeterminate image, and having placed him at the centre
of the world, said: 'I give thee, Adam, neither an appointed place nor
thine own image, nor even an appointed duty, so that thy place, thy face
and thy duty shall be according unto thine own desire, thine own will
and thine own choice. The image of other created things is determined
within the limits of the laws that I have made. Thou alone art not bound
by any limitsthou shalt fashion thine own image according to thy
wish.' \"#footnote[Pico della Mirandola, \"On Human Dignity,\"
#emph[Istoriia estetiki];, 5 vols. (Moscow: Izd. Akademii khudozhestv,
1962), vol.~1: 507.] If the freedom has been given to man by God to
fashion himself according to the likeness of other beings, from the
beasts to the angels, then the Jew has been given the same freedom in
relation to humanity as a whole, and can choose amongst other nations.
He can fashion himself in the likeness of a Spaniard or a Frenchman, a
German or a Greek, a Pole or a Russian, taking on different national
traits and remaining all the while himself, a Jew, as a man remains a
man precisely on account of the freedom of self-determination amongst
other beings. This is the origin of the diasporic tendency of the Jews,
that transnational excess of humanity which was revealed in them through
persecution and expulsion: the capability to soak up, like a sponge, the
emanations of other cultures, to become impregnated with them and to
create them anew, imparting to them the quality of universal humanity.

Precisely the same traits of swift responsiveness, imitation, and
universal sympathy are also widely discernible amongst Russians. Russia
is close to the Jew, because she too is still in an embryonic statethe
first day of creation has not yet dawned for her, but everything is in
preparation for it. As Berdyaev observed: \"There is that in the Russian
soul which corresponds to the immensity, the vagueness, the infinitude
of the Russian land, spiritual geography corresponds with physical. …
For this reason the Russian people have found difficulty in achieving
mastery over these vast expanses and in reducing them to orderly
shape.\"#footnote[Nicolas Berdyaev, #emph[The Russian Idea];, trans. R.
M. French (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962), 2.] Russian spirituality has
been and remains the spirituality of the first day of creation. \"The
Earth was without form and void, and darkness ruled upon the face of the
deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Genesis
1:2). This accounts for the characteristic Russian proclivity to \"hover
over the abyss,\" poised between boldness and spleen, flaring up and
dying out, weariness induced by the surrounding void and the immense
task of world creation. Prior to fashioning the stuff of which the world
will be made, this Spirit is in a state of agitation and feverish
ferment, procumbent on the stormy face of the waters in the dark maw of
the abyss. Here the Spirit, as yet unresolved into differentiated
elements, is still at its most whole, powerful, and menacing; it does
not have a \"form,\" like the most endless of plains, where, in Gogol's
words, \"everything is even, like an open wilderness … there is nothing
to beguile and charm the gaze.\" And further on: \"But what kind of
inscrutable and secret strength draws one to you? Why can one hear
resounding incessantly in one's ears your melancholy song, which is
borne across your entire length and breadth and from sea to sea? What is
crying out and wailing, and tugs at the heart?\" (#emph[Dead Souls];).
This Spirit is imbued with an inscrutable and secret strength because it
has as yet given form to nothing and is itself unformed, but like a
bird-troika or a word-song without origin, hovers over the depths, and
gives no answer to the query whither the troika is rushing or why the
song is resounding. Incidentally, the Biblical phrase \"the Spirit of
God moved\" is rendered in the original Hebrew by a verb signifying the
soaring of a bird; so it is not without reason that Gogol, contemplating
\"poor, scattered and disconsolate\" Rus′ from his strange and remote
vantage point, sees \"a bird-troika\" in flight over it.

Russian religious thinkers and prophet-philosophers similarly proclaim
that Russia needs another religion, not Orthodox Christianity or even
Christianity itself, which discloses the abyss of the spirit, be it
prehuman, superhuman or extra-human. Merezhkovsky observed in
Dostoyevsky's work \"a contradiction between this (religious) outlook,
which wishes to be Orthodox at all costs, and unconscious experiences
which cannot be accommodated within Orthodox Christianity. … But the
true nature of his religion, if he is not yet conscious of it and it
consists of experiences at a profoundly unconscious level, is absolutely
not Orthodox Christianity, not historical Christianity, even not
Christianity at all; rather, it goes beyond Christianity and the New
Testamentit is the Apocalypse, the Future Third Testament, the
revelation of the Third Person of the Holy Trinity: the religion of the
Holy Spirit.\"#footnote[Dmitry Merezhkovsky, #emph[V tikhom omute.
Stat′i i issledovaniia raznykh let] (Moscow: Sovetskii pisatel', 1991),
321, 345.]

Thus, Russian art is fundamentally a \"spiritual\" artand not merely the
art of Gogol, Dostoyevsky, and Tolstoy, but also that of Gorky,
Platonov, Mandelstam, Pasternak, Chagall, Brodsky, Il′ya Kabakov,
Mikhail Shvartsman. And not because art is placed in the service of
extrinsic religious aims and ideals, but rather that art assumes the
role of religious revelation which cannot be accommodated within the
dogmas of established religious creeds. This understanding of art does
not even view it as a process of form-creation, that is, the skilful
creation of perfect and complete forms, but rather as \"artisticity,\"
the dissolution of the created world by means of the artist's vision,
the outbursts of the spirit that assail the object out of a vague urge
to transform it. Russian \"artisticity\" (as distinct from Western art),
like Russian \"philosophicity\" (as opposed to Western philosophy) are
expanded and indeterminate mediums for the exploration of those areas of
human experience that remain unexplored by religionspiritual languor and
vexation of spirit, enquiry into the ultimate meanings of existence for
which no religious doctrine provides answers.

This accounts for \"holiness\" being the most important and indivisible
category of Russian spirituality, and also its concepts of \"integrity\"
and \"totality.\" \"Totality\" precedes the division into good and evil,
into beauty and ugliness, into truth and falsehood. \"In its polarities
and contradictions, the Russian people can only be compared to the
Jewish people. And it is no accident that these peoples have a strong
messianic outlook.\"#footnote[Nicolas Berdyaev, #emph[The Russian Idea];,
trans. R. M. French (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962), 2.]

#heading(level: 3, numbering: none)[Jewishness in Russians, Russianness
in Jews]
<jewishness-in-russians-russianness-in-jews>
Who in the world can understand the Russians better than the Jews? Both
are warm, soulful peoples. They share a past history of hermetic
isolation from other peoples (the Pale of Settlement and the Iron
Curtain), and through their experience of centuries of solitude, of
being cut off from the world, they accumulated a great deal of internal
warmth.

Let us set out the most striking of the traits that they have in common:

+ The religious strivings of Jews and Russians. Vladimir Solovyov
  adduced three reasons why the Jewish nation begot Christianity, and to
  a certain degree they can be also applied to the Russian nation: 1)
  the intensity with which religious preoccupations pervade national
  life; 2) the spontaneity and independence of the nation, its vitality
  and purposefulness; 3) religious materialisma system of religious
  rules separating the pure from the impure. A profound relationship to
  sanctity, including the sanctity of the material aspects of
  existencethe routine of church rituals extended to everyday life,
  fasting, utensils; the laws of the Torah and the kashrut, of ritual
  cleanliness. The warmth of the material aspects of life in God. I
  quote the words of the Russian thinker and scholar of spiritual life
  Georgy Fedotov: \"Christianity … is steadily converted into a religion
  of sanctified matter: icons, relics, holy water, amulets, communion
  bread and #emph[kulich] \[Easter cake\] … This is ritualism, but
  ritualism of a terribly demanding and morally effective kind. In his
  religious ceremonies, the Muscovite finds support for heroic feats of
  self-sacrifice, as the Jew does in the Law.\"#footnote[Georgy P.
  Fedotov, \"Pis′ma o russkoi kul′ture,\" in #emph[Sud′ba i grekhi
  Rossii. Izbrannye stat′i po filosofii russkoi istorii i kul′tury];, 2
  vols. (St Petersburg: Sofia, 1991), vol.~1: 174, 175.]

+ A tendency to utopian thinking, the subjection of all life to unified
  principles and ideals which are destined to be attained in the distant
  future: \"live for the sake of one's children, for the sake of the
  happiness of future generations\" and so forth. As Dostoyevsky
  observed, \"universal happiness is something indispensable for the
  Russian wanderer if he is to find peace: he will not settle for
  lessnaturally, while the matter remains in the realm of theory\"
  (\"Pushkin Speech,\" 1880). The enormous importance of fantasy, fairy
  tales, miracles, dreams in the national cast of mind. Both Jews and
  Russians are peoples of inspiration and Revelation, rather than of
  empirical ratiocination.

+ Adherence to the ideal of social equality and justice, readiness to
  root out aristocratic privileges even at the cost of individual
  freedom. A socialistic, egalitarian outlook, a thirst to reorder the
  entire world in accordance with religious-social teachings.
  Millennialism, eschatologism. A striving for the end of history, for
  the eternal kingdom of Truth. A revolutionary outlook. A sense that
  there is nothing that could not be parted with, that there is nothing
  to lose but one's chains. Marx and Bakunin, their mutual suspicion of
  one another as prudent revolutionary-accountant and
  revolutionary-anarchist, preparing himself and the entire world to be
  turned upside-down. And although Marxism triumphed in Russia,
  Bakuninism emerged from it and under the name of \"Leninism\"
  reconciled it with itself.

+ A feeling for the national element with which personality becomes
  merged and thereby finds itself. The tradition, long-preserved well
  into the twentieth century, of communal lifeby the world of the
  Russian peasant mir community and the Jewish shtetl. The collective
  farm and the kibbutz. The abundance of legends and anecdotes, rumours
  and gossip, communal living, whispering in corners, the habit of
  discussing everyone, neighbourliness, the small town and the village.
  #emph[Skaz];, tales, oral narratives, the strong folkloric basis for
  culture.

+ A tendency to wander, to rootlessness, the nomadic element in Russian
  civilisation which was conditioned by the sheer extent of the
  territory. To quote Chaadayev: \"In our homes it is as if we are
  assigned billets; in families we look like a kind of stranger; in
  cities we are like nomads …\"#footnote[Peter Chaadaev,
  #emph[Filosoficheskie pisma] (1836). Letter 1.
  #link("https://www.vehi.net/chaadaev/filpisma.html");.] Or
  Dostoyevsky: \"These homeless Russian wanderers continue right up to
  the present day to wander, and it seems that this practice will not
  die out for a long time\" (\"Pushkin Speech\"). The fate of the
  Wandering Jew is close to the Russian heart. The tendency of Russians
  to disperse is also attested geographically in the twentieth century
  by streams of emigrants, refugees, and defectors. These constitute one
  of the largest and culturally rich diasporas in the work, alongside
  the Jewish diaspora. The Jewish diaspora acquired in Russia the first
  homeland of socialism in the worldand the Russian diaspora, having
  been ejected from its homeland by the victory of socialism, went on to
  create a diaspora all over the world.

+ Universalism, the easy assimilation of cultural customs, of the
  scientific and technical achievements of other peoples, imitativeness,
  a flexibility of mind conditioned by the great historical experience
  of merging, co-existing with other nations. More than a hundred
  nations settled in Russia, and the Jews in the course of their
  wanderings settled on the lands of many nations. Both the Russians and
  Jews, like gifted actors, are adept at taking on alien roles.

+ Centuries-long experience of suffering and persecutions (the Egyptian
  and Babylonian captivities, the Tatar-Mongol yoke, the Pale of
  Settlement, serfdom …). From this, a tendency to melancholy, to
  despair, to grieve. In contrast to Europeans, they willingly disclose
  and share negative emotions, complain about life, and even flaunt
  their failures. (But the Jews, all the same, are more closed and
  guardedit is not done to talk aloud about death or serious illnesses.)

+ The combination of melancholy with gentle humour, lyrical enthusiasm,
  an acceptance of lifelaughter through tears (as in Gogol, Chekhov,
  Babel, Sholem Aleychem, Perets Markish). Irony and self-irony. The
  habit of laughing at everythingand first and foremost at oneself, but
  all the while preserving the sacred in one's soul.

+ Psychological openness, sociability, fondness for conversation,
  emotionality, animation, heartiness, being easily roused to the point
  of being highly strung, a readiness to share one's feelings, to trust
  what is innermost, to discuss one's personal life. Credulousness and
  gullibilitywith the difference that the Jews tend to believe other
  Jews, and the Russians to believe foreigners.

+ Both Jews and Russians are logocentric, \"literary\" nations, for whom
  the Book, the written word, is the source of higher religious and
  moral authority. In Russia, the classicsPushkin, Gogol, Dostoyevsky,
  Tolstoyassume the role of \"Sacred texts\"; they contain commandments
  and homilies and provide spiritual guidance both in social and
  personal life. The whole culture of both nations is founded on the
  Word\"holy Russian literature,\" holiness and the commandment-like
  nature of the word. As Chernyshevsky remarked, \"literature is the
  textbook of life.\" To become absorbed in a book to the point of
  frenzy, distraction, of voluptuous lassitude. The world in a fog of
  words.

+ The love of the Jews for Russian world of nature and for poetry, which
  they treat as their spiritual property. Breadth and spaciousnessin
  these there is something fated for Jews in their wanderings and
  dispersals; not a foreign land, but a new homeland, which must become
  the entire world. The melancholy of the Russian autumn, the purity of
  tints, the transparency of the air, the nakedness of the plain and the
  immensity of the skyall of these are consonant with the Jewish heart,
  a fact which finds incomparable expression in the work of Isaak
  Levitan. Nature, purged of a sense of confinement and of heat, the
  open heavens and the shining of its stars, the light, airy, and not
  exalted, humbly prostrating itself before God. This world is quite
  different to the biblical one but is nonetheless dear to that part of
  the Jewish soul which is in quest for itself in the diaspora and in
  dispersal, and partially finds itself in Russianness.

+ A musicality of soul, a love of folk melodies, for choral singing, for
  folk songs and dances. In the kibbutz, round-dances are performed as
  in Russian villages. Chekhov's #emph[Rothschild's Violin];the Russian
  bequeaths to a Jew his music and his sorrow. (Amongst Russians, the
  guitar is more popular, one encounters more drunken sincerity and
  love-songs; amongst Jews, the violin tugs at the heartstrings.)
  Dunayevsky, the brothers Pokras, Fel′tsmann, Basner, Blanter and other
  Jewish composers turned out to be the creators of the genre of the
  popular song in the USSR.

In spite of all the persecutions of the Tsarist and Soviet times, the
Jews nonetheless took root in Russia, in the midst of a reckless,
\"irregular\" people, where their love for the winding paths of life
could manifest itself fully. It comes naturally to the Jews to do
everything in a way that is not entirely free from cunning, with a
\"catch\" somewhere, with evasions and \"notwithstandings\"; but in
Russia, this was the honest and normal means of living, so they found
themselves in their native element, where they could pin their hopes not
on law and order, but only on the keenness of their wits and on God's
grace. God and nation, Tsars and prophets, wars and executions, prayers
and miracles, cruelty and clemency, intemperate violence and
unrestrained repentancehere the Jew found a passionate, fierce Biblical
world which had long since disappeared in the enlightened West, but
which was in a strange way revived for them in the Russia of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this immense country, the Jews
found their Leviathan, their fear and trembling, their beast from the
abyss described in the book of Job as being \"above God's ways\" and
simultaneously as a pitiless monster: \"all hope is in vain: shall you
not die from a single glance of his?\" In Russia it is easier than in
any other country to sense the quaking of all the foundations of
existence, the upheavals of the historical soil, as before an
earthquakethe rumble travels all over the earth, announcing the tread of
a jealous and vengeful God. This constant presentiment of catastrophe,
this menacing emanation from other worlds formed part of the Jewish fate
in biblical times, and Russia, even when Jews were consciously repelling
it, turned out to be the embodiment of an their archetype of the
\"Austere Judge\" and a \"strange attractor\" of their collective
unconscious.

#heading(level: 3, numbering: none)[The Jewish-Russian Atmosphere]
<the-jewish-russian-atmosphere>
The unique phenomenon of the Russian intelligentsia who are uprooted
from their native soil and separated from their people is comparable to
the Jewish experience of diaspora. It is precisely the Russian
intellectual, who lives as an internal exile in his own country, is
completely marginalised, is critical of everything, and is given to
utopian dreams, that exhibits the greatest spiritual kinship with the
Jew. The Jews assisted the growth of the Russian intelligentsia, and
that intelligentsia was responsible for the deep assimilation of Jewish
influences that proved decisive for Russia's culture and destiny. The
two intermingled and merged. As Fedotov remarked, \"It was no accident
that once the Jews began to emerge from their ghetto in the 1880s, we
can observe the closest comingling of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia
not only in revolutionary activities, but also in all kinds of
passionate spiritual movements; and most importantly, in their
fundamental existential outlook: in their ardent state of groundlessness
and eschatological prophecies. … Spengler saw in Russian intellectual
circles a continuation of the Talmudic tradition and
spirit.\"#footnote[Georgy P. Fedotov, \"Rossiia i svoboda,\" in
#emph[Sud′ba i grekhi Rossii. Izbrannye stat′i po filosofii russkoi
istorii i kul′tury];, 2 vols. (St Petersburg: Sofia, 1991), vol.~1:
285.]

From a western viewpoint, Jews and Russians are seen as lacking in
self-restraint, #emph[schlimazel] and unbridled. Neither nation is seen
as being #emph[comme il faut] or being from \"good society\"; both are
felt to emerge from different heights and depths of life. \"Out of the
depths, I cry unto Thee, O Lord\" and Pushkin's evocation of being \"at
the edge of the gloomy abyss\" are experiences known to both of them.
Both are inclined to give themselves up to their emotions and fantasies,
to violently surpassing limits, and at times to succumb to hysteria.
They are unaccustomed to the happy medium; they have no respect for
form, or any feeling for it. The content boils over and overflows the
rim of the vessel.

Jews and Russians incite one other, lead one another on; their steps
ring out so harmoniously when crossing the bridges of history that they
destroy them with their resonance. Precisely such a mutual incitement
and leading on occurred with the 1917 Revolution and the communist
experiment. The Jew wants to show the Russian that he is more Russian
even than hethat he is fearless, unyielding, that he will stop at
nothing (consider the phenomenon of Trotsky). The Russian wants to show
the Jew that he is even more of a Jew: far-sighted, canny, that he acts
in a fully conscious and systematic fashion and can subdue the elements
(the phenomenon of Lenin). In Fadeyev's novel #emph[Defeat];, Levinson
manifests both Russian inflexibility and Jewish awareness in his fight
with spontaneity. As a result, the Jewish qualities of shrewdness and
being systematic assume Russian characteristics of daring, recklessness
and lack of restraintsuch as the Soviet regime displayed, with its mass
of plans, its daredevilry in systematisation itself (the pressure to
complete projects ahead of schedule … to deliver the Five Year Plan in
four years … the proclamation that the present generation of Soviet
citizens would live under communism). The ecstasy and hysteria of
planning, the mania for figures, the reckless bookkeepingsuch were
typical phenomena of Soviet bureaucracy. The outlook conveyed in the
proverbial Russian exhortation, \"Strain every muscle to cut the hay,\"
was reinforced by Jewish intellectual stubbornness, meticulousness, and
the drive to bring things to their logical conclusion, even at the risk
of failure: if, according to our calculations, the bright day of
socialism should dawn, then it will do soand if it does not, then so
much the worse for reality.

The Talmudism of the Soviet regime, its passion for words and the
tiniest ideological nuances of their meaning, its faith in the
self-sufficient and self-fulfilling power of words which will render
reality more joyous and more beautifulthis is both Jewish and Russian.
As was the regime's faith in drafts on paper, and the Talmudic disputes
over interpretations of their wording, and the heated discussions of
deviations, of \"right\" and \"left\" ideological leanings, and of the
subtlest details in the employment of citations from the fundamental
texts of Marxism. They treated the latter writings as Jews treated holy
writ, as being susceptible of multilayered interpretations and
explications, like the Torah, the Mishnah, the Gemara, the Kabbala …
There was a similar Talmudic hierarchy: Marx, Engels, Lenin, then
Stalin, then subsequent foreign adherents to Marxist thoughtthe
\"outstanding representatives of the Party and government,\" the
\"founders of Socialist Realism,\" the \"writers from fellow Communist
states\" … Every level was endowed with its own degree of authority,
which could be measured by the length and frequency of citations from
their work, and the relative significance of which could be gauged with
minute accuracy from the number of column inches allotted them in the
press.

It is said about the Russians that they are a people given to extremes
and polarities. In #emph[The Russian Idea];, Berdyaev offers the
following examples: despotismand anarchism; ritualised beliefand the
search for truth; the search for Godand flagrant atheism; slaveryand
mutiny … The Jews are also a nation of extremes: hoarders and people who
are above financial self-interest; realists and fantasists; capitalists
and communists; commonsensical and prone to eccentricity. In western
nations, there is a wide zone of middle ground for a neutral and secular
way of lifewhich is only natural and is justified by human nature. Jews
and Russians constantly set themselves unrealisable tasks, and both
surpass average norms and fall short of them. The inclination to
irrationalism, existentialism and personalism in philosophy is
exemplified by Rozanov, Berdyaev, Shestov, Rozenzweig, Buber, and
Levinas.

Dostoyevsky's \"man from the underground,\" and indeed Dostoyevsky
himself are \"Jews\" in their extravagant thriftinesss, their
hyperactivity, their impulsiveness (Sholem Aleichem's Menakhem-Mendl):
everything is calculated, put in the kitty for the sake of a certain
winonly to lose ignominiously. Dostoyevsky's teenage \"yid\" dreams of
becoming a Rothschild. Tolstoy remarked on Dostoyevsky's Jewishness. The
existential situation of the underground, the state of \"nowhereness\"
characteristic of Jews were carried across into Russian literature by
Dostoyevsky.

In general, strange as it may seem, the \"anti-Semites\" Gogol and
Dostoyevsky were the first to introduce the Jewish spirit into Russian
literature. With both men, Russian society itself becomes bourgeois,
Chichikovised; it is possible that their Ukrainian and Polish roots made
them sensitive to the spirit of this derivative milieu, dominated by
preoccupations with money, gambling and speculation, in which the Jews
took root. In the case of both writers, nature recedes into the
background and \"Jewish\" ideas come to the fore: getting rich,
possessing the signs and symbols of power. A noisome urban milieu
predominatesa St Petersburg \"ghetto.\" It would be easy to imagine
Akakiy Akakiyevicha small man in a small worldas a denizen of a shtetl
or some small town in the Pale of Settlement. Both the tailor Petrovich
and the \"important personage\"such are the different ranks of
\"authority\" before whom Akakiy Akakiyevich is reduced to a trembling
creature. Similarly, Raskolnikov's way of life and mental outlook also
mark him out as a \"trembling creature,\" though he also imagines
himself to \"have entitlements.\" As has long been remarked, in
Dostoyevsky's depictions of St Petersburg, the colour yellow,
traditionally associated with Jews, predominates. \"This black and
yellow colour, this joy of Judea\" (Mandelstam).

In both nations can be observed a combination of two extremes:
spontaneous emotionality and abstract ratiocination. Inspiration and
\"gut feeling,\" a simple trust in God, and childlikeness are reflected
in Hassidism, an emotional, charismatic sect within Judaism. To live by
one's heart, to see God in small and everyday things. Hassidism, which
originated precisely on Jewish-Slavonic soil, links these nations. As
Gershom Sholem writes, \"the greater part of Russian and Polish Jewry
were drawn into the orbit of this movement (Hassidism) … but this form
of mysticism was unable to take root anywhere outside the Slavonic
countries and Russia.\"#footnote[Gershom Scholem, #emph[Major Trends in
Jewish Mysticism] (New York: Schocken, 1995), 325.] Ukraine is
considered to be only second in the world to Israel for having the
greatest number of Jewish holy places. It was proposed to build the
biggest synagogue in the world with a capacity of five thousand
worshippers in Uman, the burial place of Rabbi Nakhum. An unschooled,
unbookish relationship to Godout of an overflowing heart, in the
expectation of joy.

And yet, both nations are bookish and are devoted to the word and to
literary sermonising. Reflectiveness and premeditation. Action often
dissolves in self-reflection, in the construction of multiple points of
view, in the art of commentary and interpretation. Job and Dostoyevsky,
Buber and Bakhtin, the dialogic character of both nations, emphatically
expressed gesticulation (Russian gestures are sweeping, Jewish ones are
hasty), a love for endless conversations and verbal sparring, the loss
of a feeling of reality. A tendency to self-awareness and to experiment
on oneself is predominant. Although one of these nations possessed the
most expansive territory in the world and the other remained homeless
for many centuries, both these extremes fostered the development of an
approach to existence that was at once utopian and schematic. Rabbis,
scribes, wise men, people well versed in the scriptures, fantasists and
explicators set the tone for Judaism, all having little contact with the
reality of the society that surrounded them. Russia was created and
recreated to plan: the Christianisation of Rus by Prince Vladimir, the
Europeanisation of Russia by Peter the Great and Catherine II, the
socialist revolution and the building of communism under Lenin and
Stalin, Gorbachev's #emph[perestroika];all of this was imposed from
above, and originated in the heads of rulers. Ideas and projects always
came firstthings were not introduced and brought into being in a way
that arose organically out of national customs and ways of life, but
rather out of a fertile-brained \"head with a little organ\"
(Saltykov-Shchedrin), obsessed with the next transformative idea. This
accounts for St Petersburg being, in Dostoyevsky's phrase, \"the most
abstract and premeditated city in the world\" (#emph[Notes from
Underground];), and the spectre of communism, which sprang from the head
of Marx and was realised precisely in Russia, which has always been so
hospitable to all kinds of speculative abstractions.

This combination of Hassidism and Talmudism, of heartfelt faith and
bookish wisdom is characteristic of both nations. There are Talmudic
traits in Solovyov and Mandelstam; and Hassidic ones in Rozanov and
Pasternak. Holy foolishness, spontaneityand cultural mediatedness. Both
stem from idealism: the world is reduced to the heart or the book. The
relation of both nations to reality is a difficult one, for the European
opposition of subject and object is alien to them, their epistemology is
weakly developed, as well as its attendant search for reliable criteria
for establishing objective truth. From the excessively German Kant, the
Jews (Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer) moved towards neo-Kantianism, which
is preoccupied with collective subjectivity, a common faith which is
jointly shared rather than subjected to rational scrutiny. The
proclivity of the Jews for philosophical constructivism and intuitivism
is evident: the pupils of Cohen included Pasternak and Matvey Kagan, an
older friend and accomplice of Bakhtin. Kant's sharp and consistent
dualism is softened in neo-Kantianism in favour of \"things-for-us.\"
And the Russians were also drawn to neo-KantianismLunacharsky, Gorky,
the revisionists of Mach (Bogdanov and Yushkevich)and to the
construction of belief from human commonality, the totality of faiths,
and not from rational scrutiny seeking to establish objective truth. The
collectiveness of experience, the spirit of togetherness
\[#emph[sobornost′];\] as the decisive factor in one's orientation
towards~the~world~…

\"Yes, there was such a particular Jewish-Russian atmosphere of which
one Jewish poet said: 'Blessed is he who once breathed
it.' \"#footnote[Fedotov, \"Rossiia i svoboda,\" 285.]

#heading(level: 3, numbering: none)[The Fourth Jerusalem]
<the-fourth-jerusalem>
Messianic strivings and the belief in being God's chosen people
simultaneously unify and divide both nations. One of them, in accordance
with their forefathers' covenant with God, is obliged to preserve its
spiritual isolation; the other to embrace all other nations with
Christian love. Both Israel and Russia are \"holy lands.\" This is not
merely a typological likeness, but also a conscious historical
continuity. The first #emph[attempts] to liken Russia to the New Israel
and Moscow to the New Jerusalem are found in Russian sources that date
back to the late fifteenth century; and Russians at times called
themselves \"the true Israelite proselytes.\" Thus, the subsequent tense
relations between both nations can be explained as a kind of messianic
jealousy about which was God's chosen people, and whose time had come
and whose time had passed. Both messianic aspirations fused for a time
in the Bolshevik Revolution.

The notion that Moscow was the Third Rome, which inspired Russian
religious self-imagining since the sixteenth century, was in essence a
metaphor or a parable of another, more profound, though unarticulated
formulanamely, Moscow as the Fourth Jerusalem. For Rome was the second,
both in temporal succession and in importance as a sanctuary of
religious belief, after Jerusalem. The third Jerusalem was
Constantinople, and Moscow was consequently the fourth. Why did the
importance of Jerusalem itself, the beginning of the beginnings, wane in
this messianic succession?

The answer, of course, is that Jerusalem was unsuited to being the
centre of a newly-created Christian #emph[empire];, because it had never
been an imperial capital. The magic of the number three, sanctified by
its association with the Trinity, also played its role. But one can also
adduce yet another reason: the connection with Jerusalem, and with God's
chosen people, was so important for Russia that it remained in the
depths of its religious unconscious; it also determined the strange and
rationally inexplicable intensity of its relationship with the
historically dispossessed and politically powerless Jews. Rome and
Byzantium were empires, but the Roman and the Byzantine nations were not
God's chosen people. Russia, on the other hand, laid claim not only to
being an empireand thereby being the successor of Rome and
Constantinoplebut also to the fact of being God's chosen people. In this
respect, it was the direct successor of the Jewish nation. This
messianic component of the \"Russian idea\" was scarcely no whit less
important than the imperial one, and concealed far greater ambitions,
for it pertained not to political horizontalsthat is, to world
conquestbut to religious verticals, namely, to being chosen by God. The
Jewish nation was also chosen by Godbut it did not found an empire. The
Romans (both western and eastern) founded an empire, but they were not
chosen by God. The Russian nation, however, was called to the higher
synthesis of both missions, the \"Jerusalemite\" and the \"Roman.\"

This fermentation of the \"Russian idea\" with Jewish leaven did not
merely remain in the realms of wishful thinking. Within Russian Orthodox
Christianity, there is genuinely something close to the religious
psychology of the Jew, and correspondingly, in Judaism there is
something akin to the religious psychology of the Russian. This fact
explains the Judaizing sects in Rusthe \"Judaizers\" and the
\"Sabbatarians.\" It also explains the frequent conversations of Jews to
Russian Orthodox Christianity in the late Soviet epochwhich did not take
place for careerist reasons, as was often the case in tsarist Russia,
but due to spiritual attraction, as conversion to Russian Orthodox
Christianity did not remove, but doubled and tripled the burden of life
in the atheistic State. To persecution directed at Jews was now added
persecution directed at believers, as well as suspicion of the very
presence of a Jew inside the interior of an Orthodox church: converts
had to contend with the mistrust of their fellow communicants towards
non-Russians and the mistrust of their fellow Jews towards voluntary
converts to Christianity.

At a meeting with rabbis in New York on 13 November 1991, Patriarch
Aleksey II (Ridiger) declared in a speech characteristically entitled,
\"Your prophets are our prophets\":

#quote(block: true)[
The union of Judaism and Christianity has a real basis in spiritual and
natural affinity and positive religious interests. We are at one with
Jews, not giving up Christianity, not in spite of Christianity, but in
the name and strength of Christianity; and Jews are at one with us not
in spite of Judaism, but in the name and strength of true Judaism. We
are thus set apart from the Jews by the fact that we are \"not fully
Christian\"; while the Jews are set apart from us because they are \"not
fully Jewish.\" For the fullness of Christianity embraces Judaism, and
the fullness of Judaism is Christianity.#footnote[The full speech of
Patriarch Aleksey II is reproduced here:
#link("https://mparchiv.narod.ru/alravvin.html");.]
]

Whatever one might think of these sentiments, they are characteristic of
Orthodox Christianity, especially in its Russian manifestation, to a
much greater measure than is the case with other major Christian
denominations. In an Orthodox church, the sanctuary is set apart and
concealed from parishioners, just like the \"Holy of Holies\" in the
Jewish Temple. In Catholic churches, and even more so in Protestant
ones, the altar is brought forward, corresponding to the incarnation of
God in man and His visible and tangible manifestation in the world. When
Christ was crucified, the veil which set apart the secret part of the
temple was rent, for the secret of God was disclosed to the people when
he took on human form and died on the Cross. But there was of God
something that remained out of bounds and which did not merge with man.
And thus, as if as a sign of the non-merger of both natures in Christ,
the Russian Orthodox Church from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
onwards erected the iconostasis between the worshippers and the altar so
that the preparation for the mystery of Communion could take place in
secret from the worshippers themselves. This separation is also a sign
of the \"out-of-bounds-ness\" of God for man, the incomprehensibility of
his mystery that is also emphasised in apophatic (negative) theology,
which principally developed in Eastern Christianitythat is, the
knowledge of God in his inaccessibility by the negation of all his names
and likenesses.

Is this not also the purpose of the iconostasisnot merely to bring God
closer to the believer through images, but also to set him apart by mean
of the very veil of these images? The iconostasis simultaneously makes
visible (the image of the Son) and conceals that which ought to remain
invisible (the action of the Holy Spirit on the altar): it is not only a
window onto another world, but also a veil between two worlds. The icon
is a visual paradox of concealment-by-disclosure, which in Judaism is
solved in favour of concealment, but in western Christianity in favour
of disclosure. Thus, the icon is of such importance in Russian Orthodox
Christianity, which mediates between Judaism, with its understanding of
the out-of-bounds-ness of God, and western Christianity, with its
emphasis on the human and the taking on of human form in God. The same
dual relationship ought to be maintained towards the icon, the
contemplation of which should set bounds to the act of contemplation
itself. It is impossible to approach it not only as a self-sufficient
sacred object (that is, as an idol), but also as a transparent likeness
of sacred persons (as a picture). For faith, in the words of St Paul, is
'confidence in the invisible'. The invisible has been made visible in
other to conceal the invisible more effectively and to strengthen our
faith in it.

The same \"Jewishness\" of Russian Orthodox Christianityin comparison
with Catholicismis also discernible in their Creeds. The dividing term
is the #emph[filioque] (and the Son)it would seem as a purely formal
obstacle. Is this a significant differencewhether the Holy Spirit
proceeds only from the Father, as the Orthodox Creed implies, or
additionally from the Son (#emph[filioque];), as the Catholic Church
maintains? But precisely in this incommensurability between the Paternal
and the Filial can be discerned the closeness of Russian Orthodoxy to
the Jewish notion of the out-of-bounds-ness of God. It would seem that
for Christianity the entire plenitude of God takes human form as
manifest in Christand this divine assumption of human form is emphasised
in Catholicism and to an even greater degree in Protestantism,
simultaneously with the move of the altar closer to the worshippers. But
just as the \"Holy of Holies\" is protected in an Orthodox church, in
the Orthodox Creed, God the Father fully contains within Himself the
mysterious source from whence proceeds the Holy Spirit, not transferring
it to the Sonit is elevated above both other hypostases.

Meanwhile, Catholicism also took the next step towards the abolition of
that mysterious veil. Not only is the entire plenitude of the power of
God the Father transferred to the Son, but also all the power of Christ
is transferred to his sole representative on Earththe Pope. In
Catholicism, the Pope is the Vicar of Christ, His deputy on Earththat
is, not only does the God-man fully partake of the Divine, but what is
more, the human fully partakes of the God-man. The Pope is endowed with
complete infallibility when he pronounces #emph[ex cathedra];.

Therefore, the two fundamental differences between Catholicism and
Russian Orthodox Christianitythe #emph[filioque] and the papacycome down
precisely to the abolition of the transcendence of God, first in the
fusion of the human and the divine and then in the incarnation of the
divine in the human. Russian Orthodox Christianity, of all Christian
faiths, adheres most closely to Judaism, preserving the most precisely
defined hierarchy, the subordination of the hypostases and emphasising
the out-of-bounds-ness of God to all humanity and even to the Godman
himself.

In the work of the Russian philosopher Semyon Frank, an ethnic Jew who
converted to Russian Orthodox faith, Christianity is understood in an
apophatic spirit which is in general closer to Eastern than to Western
Christianity. This apophatism is a Jewish trait inside Christianity: the
notion that God did not become fully incarnate in human form and remains
inaccessible to comprehension. Frank adheres to the doctrine of Nicholas
of Cusa about knowing unknowingness or \"learned ignorance\"that is,
that one can only know God through one's ignorance of Him. Frank's most
important work, #emph[The Incomprehensible];, in essence propounds
apophatism as being half way between Christianity and Judaism: \"being
conscious of and feeling 'my God,' I cannot and do not have the right to
lose sight of that depth of His in which He is the unspeakable,
unknowable, and terrible (in His unknowableness) Divinity, which
essentially transcends all definition.…\"#footnote[S. L. Frank,
#emph[The Unknowable: An Ontological Introduction to the Philosophy of
Religion];, trans. Boris Jakim (Brooklyn, NY: Angelico Press, 2020),
242.] In this sense, Frank is a Jewish-Christian thinker.

The Orthodox priest Aleksandr Men′ (1930), an ethnic Jew, was the
\"godfather\" of the Soviet intelligentsia, which accounts for his
transformative role in the development of post-Soviet Orthodoxy as
opposed to its pre-Revolutionary form. This form of Orthodoxy became
imbued with that \"internationalism\" which emerged during the Soviet
period from Russian-Jewish atheismbut bestows on this union a religious
dimension. By this I do mean neither the Christianisation of Judaism and
the Judaization of Orthodox Christianity, nor the reciprocal religious
conversions between these faiths, but rather the establishment of
intermediate, transitional degrees of a common tradition of spiritual
life. Take the baptism of Russian Jews at the end of the twentieth
century: this did not separate many of them from Jewishness, but rather
brought them closer to itinto the bosom of Abraham and David from which
Christ and the apostles came forth. It may be that precisely Russian
Jewry afforded both Christianity and Judaism an opportunity to discover
a mode of psychological relatedness to one another, to draw closer
voluntarily as never before, except in the times of the apostles, and in
the presaging of the end of time, when the coming of the Messiah is
promised to both Jews and Christians.

And so one can understand why the purely negative experience of
communism proved instructive for both nations, and stimulated them to
try to become closer on account of religious and not atheistic
affinities. Formerly, it was easiest for Jews and Russians to converge
in their idealistic materialism, in stubborn and fanatical atheism, in
disbelief as a variety of belief. Their atheism, in contradistinction to
western atheism, which is rational and enlightened, was itself a form of
faith, a utopian one, and their denial of the existence of God was
itself religious. Communism was the convergence of Christians and Jews
on the paths of negation equally of Christianity and Judaismand thus,
having made evident the negative and self-destructive results of such a
renunciation, prepared the conditions for a positive religious
convergence of both nations. This is why Berdyaev and Buber, who had
first-hand experience of Russian communism and Jewish socialism and
found themselves on the paths of Christianity and Judaism, were inwardly
akin to one another.

In his collection of essays #emph[Shield] of 1915, Vyacheslav Ivanov,
observing the evolution of \"Aryan\" ideology, expressed the thought
that anti-Judaism always becomes transformed into anti-Christianity as a
matter of course, as the subsequent history of Nazism confirmed. In its
turn, the history of communism confirmed that, conversely,
anti-Christianity eventually transforms itself into anti-Semitism.
Judaism and Christianity are not only linked historically, but also
bound up with one another as systems of beliefs and values; and denying
one will sooner or later cause the other to be denied too. In the
Russian nationalist movement of the 1980s and 1990s, hostility to
Judaism and Russian Orthodox anti-Semitism quickly led to the denial of
Christianity from the position of Vedantism, neo-paganism and \"native
faith\" \[#emph[rodnoveriye];\].

#heading(level: 3, numbering: none)[Philias and Phobias]
<philias-and-phobias>
The fact that the founder of Communism Karl Marx was both an anti-Semite
and a Russophobe was a good reason for the two nations to draw closer
together, as they both managed to survive communism and free themselves
from the yoke of Marxism. This judgement can only be made out of love
for both nations, from a standpoint of both Russophilia and Judeophilia.
Unfortunately, terms of hatred still predominate in Russian. When one
does a Google search for information in Russian about the word
\"Judeophilia,\" the automated message appears \"Did you mean
Judeophobia?\" In fact, on Russian-language internet sites, the word
\"Judeophobia\" occurs eighteen times more frequently than
\"Judeophilia\" (90,000 results and 5,000 results respectively). If one
compares the data for the search terms \"anti-Semitism\" and
\"philo-Semitism,\" then the difference is even more pronounced:
4,000,000 results as opposed to 2,000. Should one infer from this that
anti-Semites are two thousand times more numerous than philo-Semites? I
will refrain from drawing simplistic conclusions about attitudes, but
even in relation to Russians, the language of hatred predominates: the
search term \"Russophobia\" returns 1,400,000 results, and
\"Russophilia\" merely 20,000.

My personal position in relation to the two vitally important national
questions can be summed up in one word: #emph[Judeo-Russophilia];. I
propose this term for general use. It is especially helpful in a
situation where Russophiles are usually considered (and indeed sometimes
actually are) Judeophobes, and Judeophiles are considered Russophobes.
The term usefully emphasises the compatibility of these philias, which
are understood by manywithout any foundationto be mutually hostile and
mutually exclusive.

What is at issue here is love for another nation, and not one's own.
Love for one's own nation and culture usually goes without saying, and
it is even inappropriate to express it. It would be odd for a Russian to
be a Russophile, a Jew to be a Judeophile, a German to be a
Germanophile, and so on. It would be like answering the question \"who
do you love?\" with \"myself.\" Just as it befits a Russian by and large
to be a Germanophile, a Polonophile, a Judeophile or an Anglophile, but
not a Russophile, it similarly befits a German to be a Russophile or a
Francophile. However, in the nineteenth century, Slavophiles appeared
amongst the Slavs themselves, just as Germanophiles appeared amongst
Germans, and this was naturally a sign of trouble: only someone for whom
things are going badly starts to declare love for himself. One has to
take pity on him and understand the reason for his recourse to
self-love, when his love should be directed at others.

Thus, by the loftiest standards, it does not become Russians or Jews or
Russian Jews to experience Judeo-Russophiliathat is something for the
Germans, the Italians or the Americans, if they are roused to particular
interest in and favour towards Russia, Judaism and the unique
intersection of their destinies. But in the real and very unfavourable
situation in which we find ourselves, a state of schism between a
multiplicity of national self-loves and mutual xenophobias, it would be
greatly advantageous even if one reinforced the feeling of self-love
with the love for a culture which is closely related and parallel, but
which in essence is even perpendicular. Under such conditions,
#emph[Judeo-Russophilia] is not an egocentric idea, but an eirenic one,
which prompts us to understand and accept these \"fateful crossings.\"

The end of the twentieth century was the time when the two nations
parted, and perhaps also the time of their new mutual recognition. Once
liberated from the equally onerous yoke of Communist rule which they had
created jointly by their own efforts, they could now, at the point of
leave-taking, take a close look at one another and understand why fate
had brought them together, and what lesson the world could draw from
their encounter and leave-taking. Russians and Jewsof all nationsturned
out to be (and, indeed, were from the very beginning) the most Soviet.
They laid claim to their own particular national terrain to a lesser
extent than any other nations in the USSR, for it was they who embodied
the internationalism of the new order. Other nations had their own
territories (in the sense that they kept them or created them anew),
their own customs, traditions, national festivals; but the Russians and
Jews were permitted almost nothing of the kind, so that they would
embody the very idea of Soviet rulea self-denial of a separate past in
the name of the brotherhood of the workers of the world. The Jews had a
nominally autonomous region in Siberia, Birobidzhan, but they did not
live there; the Russians nominally had their own republic, the Russian
Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but its administrative organs were
weakened by the fact that they largely overlapped with the overarching
Soviet ones (the so-called \"Soviet-Republic Ministries\"). Russians and
Jews were not nations, but rather the flesh and blood of the new
transnational commonwealth of the Soviet people. There were doubts as to
whether the Jews could even be considered a nation, or whether, in the
absence of a territorial community, they should be considered a
\"pseudo-nation.\" Russians were also considered to be transnationals,
\"the elder brother\" in the family of Soviet nationsthat is, as if they
were responsible for the entire family in the absence of the deceased
father (God and the Tsar). Jews were \"an insufficient nation\" and
Russians were a \"trans-nation,\" but in both roles they had to suppress
their own individual nationalitymost of all, when it came to religion.

Therefore, the collapse of the USSR meant first and foremost the
sundering of Russians and Jews, who returned to their own national
existences. But it was precisely then that the time came for deeper and
freely creative relations between the two nations, now that they were no
longer bound by the yoke of their combined fates and the injuries caused
by a difficult way of life. In a certain sense, the USSR did not fall
asunder into Russia and the other constituent republics, but into Russia
and the diaspora: the Russian diaspora and the Jewish one. The republics
adjoined other areas that were more capacious religiously and
culturally, and to which they had formerly partially belonged (the
central Asian republics to Islam, the Baltic republics to Western Europe
…). But the USSR was created to a significant degree by the interaction
of Russian and Jewish religious utopianism, precisely on that common
international and atheistic soil, where they rejected their own
religions and thereby their nationality. With the collapse of the USSR,
the messianic and totalitarian era in Russian history came to an end,
and each nation has been given back its separate fate.
