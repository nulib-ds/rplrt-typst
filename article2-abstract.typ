Title: Varieties of Belief in #emph[The Brothers Karamazov]

Author: Gary Saul Morson

Abstract:

Since the Enlightenment, many intellectuals have presumed that religious
belief is an aspect of human psychology that can---and ought---to be
avoided. Fyodor Dostoevsky rejects this assumption. His novels contend
that faith cannot be easily evaded, because belief is integral to human
experience. This article explores how Dostoevsky understood faith as an
activity that mirrored more ostensibly secular pursuits, like play
acting. Morson analyzes four varieties of role playing, and, by
extension, of believing, in #emph[The Brothers Karamazov];. These roles
include: the liar (Fyodor), the aesthete (Dmitri), the skeptic (Ivan),
and the believer (Alyosha). Much like belief, play acting is often
distinguished from the real activity. The stage has an illusory quality.
Yet Dostoevsky's novels show that the seam between life and acting is
more porous than one might think, because pretension and sincerity are
often indistinguishable in human psychology. Dostoevsky implies that if
actions can be concurrently feigned and genuine, then the basis of all
human activity is one of simultaneously believing and unbelieving. The
upshot is that “belief” includes doubt and imperfection; faith is a
dynamic process. The paradoxes of belief thus illuminate the paradoxes
of human nature. Humans are beings in transition; forever striving to
believe or reject that what they already, in some sense, believe.

Keywords: Fyodor Dostoevsky, #emph[Brothers Karamazov];, play acting,
