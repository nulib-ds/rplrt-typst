  [
    Since the Enlightenment, many intellectuals have presumed that religious
belief is an aspect of human psychology that can---and ought---to be
avoided. Fyodor Dostoevsky rejects this assumption. His novels contend
that faith cannot be easily evaded, because belief is integral to human
experience. This article explores how Dostoevsky understood faith as an
activity that mirrored more ostensibly secular pursuits, like play
acting. Morson analyzes four varieties of role playing, and, by
extension, of believing, in #emph[The Brothers Karamazov];. These roles
include: the liar (Fyodor), the aesthete (Dmitri), the skeptic (Ivan),
and the believer (Alyosha). Much like belief, play acting is often
distinguished from the real activity. The stage has an illusory quality.
Yet Dostoevsky's novels show that the seam between life and acting is
more porous than one might think, because pretension and sincerity are
often indistinguishable in human psychology. Dostoevsky implies that if
actions can be concurrently feigned and genuine, then the basis of all
human activity is one of simultaneously believing and unbelieving. The
upshot is that “belief” includes doubt and imperfection; faith is a
dynamic process. The paradoxes of belief thus illuminate the paradoxes
of human nature. Humans are beings in transition; forever striving to
believe or reject that what they already, in some sense, believe.  ]

#epigraph[Lord, I believe; help Thou my unbelief. --- Mark 9:24]

Starting with its first chapter, #emph[The Brothers Karamazov]
introduces a theme to be developed throughout the novel: what does it
mean to believe something? Could “belief” (or faith---also #emph[vera];)
be a single term for several different states of mind? And what about
second-order beliefs: can one be mistaken in one's belief about what one
believes? Can one believe and disbelieve something at the same time?

Describing Fyodor Pavlovich's marriage to Adelaida Ivanovna, “who
belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family,” the novel's
narrator explains that her choice was perplexing: “How it came to pass
that an heiress, who was also a beauty , and moreover one of those
lively, intelligent girls not at all uncommon in this generation, but
somehow also to be found in the last, could have married such an
insignificant ‘puny fellow, as everyone called him, I won't attempt to
explain.”#footnote[Fyodor Dostoevsky, #emph[The Brothers Karamazov];,
2#super[nd] edition, ed. Susan McReynolds, the Garnett translation
revised by Ralph E. Matlaw and Susan McReynolds (New York: Norton,
2011), 11. Further references are to #emph[BK];. I have occasionally
modified the translation.] And then, of course, he does, by citing
another strange courtship:

#quote(block: true)[
But I knew a young lady, still of the ‘romantic' generation before the
last, who after some years of enigmatic love for a gentleman, whom she
might easily have married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles
to their union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a
rather deep and rapid river, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her
own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia, and indeed, if this
precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less
picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most
likely the suicide would not have taken place (#emph[BK];, 11-12).
]

_There have been many such cases in Russian life_, the narrator continues.
A person adopts a role and acts it out, like a stage actor who madly
decides he really is the character he plays. At the same time, the
person subscribes to a whole set of her generation's prescribed beliefs.
Does she really believe them?

Elsewhere Dostoevsky describes such thinking as “wearing a uniform.” One
adopts a prefabricated philosophy wholesale. Dostoevsky loved to
satirize people like this: in #emph[Crime and Punishment];,
Lebeziatnikov professes one absurd progressive belief after another, and
yet it is plain he has never actually assessed the arguments for any one
of them. In Dostoevsky's view, people who think this way---especially
the educated who pride themselves on their critical thinking---buy a
whole package at a time. No arguments or evidence could ever shake any
of these beliefs because no argument or evidence led to its adoption. As
Jonathan Swift once remarked, no one was ever talked out of a belief he
had not first been talked into.

Adelaida Ivanovna resembled this would-be Ophelia, except that the
beliefs she adopted were those of the next, radical, rather than
romantic, generation. Her marriage to Fyodor Pavlovich, the narrator
surmises, resulted from “an echo of alien influences” (or “foreign
currents of opinion” \[#emph[otgoloskom chuzhikh veyanij];\]). Perhaps
she “wanted to assert feminine impendence,” or “go against social
conventions” or “against the despotism of her family and birth”---all
canned phrases for hackneyed fashionable ideas. Because she perceived
the world through these lenses, “an obliging imagination persuaded her”
that the sponger Fyodor Pavlovich was “one of the boldest and most
ironical people of that epoch that was transitional to everything
better”---the hackneyed ideas accumulate here---even though he was
obviously, to anyone not blinded by assumed ways of seeing, “just an
evil buffoon and nothing more” (#emph[BK];, 12).

We may ask: did Adelaida Ivanovna actually believe these ideas? She
evidently did in the sense that she acted on them. But the element of
play acting here---the pleasure of the heroic role and the work of her
“obliging imagination”---strongly suggest she didn't. It seems one can
sincerely profess what one at some level knows to be untrue. In that
case, which does one really believe? This question will recur in
Dostoevsky's descriptions of other theatrical behavior, most obviously,
that of Fyodor Pavlovich.

Belief (and faith) are examined time and again. Dostoevsky interrupts
his description of “The Unfortunate Gathering” with two chapters about
faith: “Believing Peasant Women” (Or “Peasant Women who Have
Faith”---\[#emph[Veruyushchie baby];\]) and “A Lady of Little Faith”
(#emph[Malovernaya dama];). The repetition of the root #emph[vera]
(belief or faith) in these chapter titles suggests the importance and
complexity of this theme.

== Doubting Thomas

In different ways, Fyodor Pavlovich and his three legitimate sons
illustrate important insights about the nature of belief. When the
narrator introduces Alyosha, he mentions the boy's belief in miracles.
Readers will probably suspect Alyosha of “mysticism and fanaticism,” he
anticipates, but in this case that judgment would be hasty. Alyosha, he
says, “was more of a realist than anyone.” To explain this apparent
paradox, the narrator expatiates on the nature of belief.

#quote(block: true)[
Oh, no doubt in the monastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to my
thinking, miracles are never a stumbling block to the realist. It is not
miracles that dispose realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is
an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in
the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable
fact, he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact.
Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then
unrecognized by him (#emph[BK];, 28).
]

Religions usually offer miracles as proof. Jesus raised Lazarus from the
dead, so how can you doubt His divinity? The narrator regards this
argument as naïve because it presumes that people are bound to accept
clear and indubitable evidence.

David Hume famously refuted miracles by asking, which is more likely:
that the laws of nature were suspended or that people in a credulous
age, who wanted to believe in the supernatural, found a way to do so? He
asked us to weigh evidence rationally, but, according to the narrator of
#emph[Karamazov];, people already committed to one side of the argument
will not do so. Even if the miracles were performed right in front of
the “realist's” eyes---“if he were \[directly\] confronted with a
miracle as an irrefutable fact”---the demonstration would make no
difference to his belief or disbelief. “He would rather disbelieve his
own senses.”

If that is so, is he truly a realist? Scientific realists supposedly
respect the evidence. One does not just deduce or assert a truth, one
has to test it by experiment. The experiment can disprove the
hypothesis, or it is not a real experiment. As Karl Popper would later
say, the hypothesis must be falsifiable. If a scientist is so wedded to
a theory that he ignores an experiment that disconfirms it, is he really
a scientist at all? Or, to use the narrator's term, a “realist”? As the
narrator points out, many who act like real scientists in their
day-to-day work find themselves unable to do so when the ideology they
associate with science itself is questioned. In #emph[A Writer's Diary]
Dostoevsky imagines the chemist Mendeleev, who vigorously denied the
existence of supernatural beings, being lifted into the air by demons
who perform tricks that preclude scientific explanation. As a respecter
of the evidence, Mendeleev would be obliged to acknowledge the
supernatural, but would he?

According to the narrator, the scientist has one last resource: to admit
the disconfirming evidence he has witnessed, but maintain that this
apparently supernatural occurrence is really a “a fact of nature till
then unrecognized.” The problem with this move is that it makes the
argument against the supernatural into a tautology: if anything
manifestly supernatural is simply called another form of the natural,
then naturalism is true by definition.

The passage from #emph[Karamazov] continues:

#quote(block: true)[
Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle
from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very
realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he
would not believe until he saw, but when he did see he said, “My Lord
and my God!” Was it the miracle that forced him to believe? Most likely
not, but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly
he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said, “I shall not
believe except I see” (#emph[BK];, 28).
]

Evidently it is possible to believe and disbelieve at the same time. One
may sincerely profess a conviction and yet, like Doubting Thomas, not
accept it in one's “secret heart.” The narrator supposes that, even
though Thomas thought the miracle convinced him, it in fact merely
revealed to him what he already believed. If so, it is possible not only
to believe and disbelieve simultaneously, but also simultaneously to
change one's mind and not change it.

Thomas believed “solely because he desired to believe.” Is it really
possible to believe something “solely” because one wants to? I cannot
decide to believe in Ptolemaic astronomy just because I choose to. And
yet one can get oneself to believe what one either knows or easily could
know to be untrue. It happens whenever one deceives oneself.

According to the narrator, Alyosha believed in miracles because he had
faith. Far from deceiving himself, he was a “realist” believing without
reservation in the world as he experienced it. But what if that world
should disconfirm his belief? What if he had to choose between his
realism and his belief in miracles? That is precisely what happens.

== Fyodor Pavlovich: The Liar

Early in the novel the narrator describes how Fyodor Pavlovich loves to
play a part “even to his own direct disadvantage,” as he did when Miusov
proposes to adopt little Mitya (#emph[BK];, 15). Fyodor Pavlovich's
treatment of his infant son has gone far beyond mere neglect: “he wholly
and utterly abandoned his child by Adelaida Ivanovna, not from malice
towards him or because of any wounded matrimonial feelings, but simply
because he completely forgot him” (BK, 14). Describing Fyodor Pavlovich,
Dostoevsky sometimes stretches the boundaries of realism: is it possible
actually to forget one's child “completely”?

To be sure, Fyodor Pavlovich can be reminded of his son, even if he
might pretend otherwise. “Long afterward he \[Miusov\] used to recount,
as a characteristic trait of the man, that when he began to speak to
Fyodor Pavlovich about Mitya, for some time he looked completely
uncomprehending, as though he seemed surprised that he had a young son
somewhere in the house. If there may have been some exaggeration in
Pytor Aleksandrovich's \[Miusov's\] story, still there must have been
something resembling the truth” (#emph[BK];, 15). One may suppose that
Fyodor Pavlovich, when reminded of what he usually forgot, pretended to
be still forgetting---that is, he pretended to be what he really was.

Fyodor Pavlovich takes the greatest pleasure in parodying or mocking
anything that anyone regards as sacred. “Great elder, speak!,” he
proclaims in Father Zosima's cell. “What must I do to gain eternal
life?,” aping the lawyer's appeal to Jesus (Luke 11:27). One reason it
is sometimes “difficult to decide” whether Fyodor Pavlovich is
pretending or sincere is that he himself cannot always tell the
difference. “With old liars who have been acting all their lives,” the
narrator explains, “there are moments when they enter so completely into
their part that they tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest,
although at that very moment, or a second later they are able to whisper
to themselves, ‘You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You're
acting now, in spite of your ‘holy' moment of
wrath.”#footnote[#emph[BK];, 68. My thanks to Ryan Serrano, who is
writing a splendid dissertation on role-playing, for calling my
attention to this passage.]

One can shed tears “in earnest” while knowing “at that very moment” that
one is lying. That isn't true with ordinary self-deception. Neither does
it resemble Doubting Thomas's mistaken belief in his change of mind.
Fyodor Pavlovich “really” feels what he knows is pretense. But not
completely, because the sense of having pretended does not altogether
disappear.

But it can, as sometimes happens when people choose to feel insulted.
“You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense,” Father Zosima
observes to Fyodor Pavlovich. “A man may know that nobody has insulted
him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and
exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a
mountain out of a molehill---he knows that himself, yet he will be the
first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels
great pleasure in it, and so pass on to genuine vindictiveness”
(#emph[BK];, 43). #emph[And so pass on to genuine vindictiveness];: What
begins as pretense becomes genuine feeling---genuine in the sense that
one really feels vindictive and loses the awareness of pretense. And yet
the feeling is at the same time fake. We lack a name for this condition.

How much of the world's evil is due to it? As Dostoevsky often shows,
people sometimes crave to be insulted and injured so as to feel morally
superior. As Dmitri says of his fiancé Katerina Ivanovna, she loves her
own virtue, not him. She tries to get him to betray her so she can show
her nobility. But is it nobility to rise above an offense one has
deliberately provoked? How aware is she of what she is doing? When Ivan
hints at her pretense, she falls into hysterics, which suggests she both
knows and does not know at the same time.

Katerina Ivanovna lives a lie, but she does so sincerely in the sense
that she does not know she lives a lie. What make Fyodor Pavlovich
unique---not only in this book but, I think, in world literature---is
that he knows that his “genuine” vindictiveness, which he really feels,
is not at all genuine, and yet is able to continue believing in it
without losing the consciousness of falsity. Katerina Ivanovna lies, and
conceals the lie from herself: Fyodor Pavlovich is fully aware of lying
to himself and yet can indulge in it with all the fervor that she does.
Indeed, he does everything he can to exaggerate the contradictions, as a
kind of sport.

== Dmitri

Dmitri tells Alyosha that, in the depths of degradation, he experiences
ugliness as beautiful. “Beauty is a terrible and awful thing,” he
confides. “It is terrible because it has not been defined and is
undefinable, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the two shores of
the rivers meet and all contradictions stand side by side. #sym.dots.h  We must
solve them as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water
”(#emph[BK];, 98). One cannot keep a dry skin in the water, or water
would not be wet; if shores meet, then they are no longer shores; but
some contradictions do seem to stand side by side. How, Dmitri wonders,
can he regard something as ugly and beautiful at the same time? What's
more, a man with the ideal of the Madonna in his heart---who believes in
it sincerely---can at the very same moment adhere to “the ideal of
Sodom. What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in
his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may
be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in the days of
his youth and innocence” (#emph[BK];, 98). In youth, one might well
believe in goodness and beauty without being aware of one's own evil and
ugly impulses. Lack of self-knowledge would explain that. But what about
simultaneously, and with full awareness, adhering to both with equal
sincerity? Isn't that like believing in two mutually exclusive
propositions? If I believe it is raining, how can I at that very moment
believe it is not raining? If one can believe both, what does it mean
“to believe”?

Dmitri simultaneously and knowingly believes in Sodom and the Madonna.
That is not supposed to be possible, and if it somehow is, it shouldn't
be! “Man is broad, too broad, indeed,” Dmitri concludes. “I'd have him
narrower.” That, of course, is what Ivan's Grand Inquisitor proposes to
do.

== Ivan's Belief and Disbelief

At once an extreme moralist and an amoral denier that objective morality
exists, Ivan is even more disturbed than Dmitri by his adherence to
contradictory beliefs. As an amoralist, he believes that the laws of
nature explain everything. They have no moral content: asking whether
Newton's law of universal gravitation is moral or amoral makes no sense.
Since people are just complex natural objects subject to the same
natural laws as everything else, morality can be nothing more than
social convention---necessary for social stability, perhaps, but no less
groundless for that. It is one thing on this side of the Pyrenees,
something else on the other, as Pascal observed. “Three degrees of
latitude upset the whole of jurisprudence and one meridian determines
what is true.”#footnote[Blaise Pascal, #emph[Pascal Pensées];, trans. A.
J. Krailsheimer (Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1987), 46.] From this
perspective, questions about life's meaning make no more sense than
those about morality.

The devil who visits Ivan paraphrases his poem “The Geological
Cataclysm,” which argues that it will be some time before everyone
grasps the amoral truth, but “everyone who recognizes the truth even now
may legitimately order his life as he pleases. #sym.dots.h In that sense, ‘all
things are permitted' for him.” “That's all very charming,” the devil
retorts, “but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction
for doing it? But that's our modern Russian all over. He can't bring
himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He's so in love with
truth…” (#emph[BK];, 546).

But Ivan also believes just the opposite, that good and evil (at least,
evil) are absolute. In reciting his horrifying stories of child abuse,
Ivan means to show that such evil cannot be argued away or justified by
either religious theodicy, rationalist nihilism, or any other theory.
Believing firmly in both evil and moral nihilism, Ivan is torn apart.

A keen psychologist, Zosima diagnoses Ivan's problem. The conflict is
“unresolved in your heart and torments it,” Zosima tells him. “That
question is not solved in you, and it is your grief, for it demands an
answer” (#emph[BK];, 65-6). When Ivan asks if his question can ever be
resolved “in the affirmative”---whether he will come to believe in
meaning and good and evil---Zosima replies that “it will never be
decided in the negative.” That is, Ivan will never become a complacent
nihilist, like his father, but will either find meaning or go on
searching. “You yourself know that that is the peculiarity of your
heart; and all its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who
gave you a lofty heart, capable of such suffering, of thinking and
seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the heavens” (#emph[BK];,
66).

The devil who haunts Ivan mocks his hesitation between opposite truths
by making Ivan also hesitate between affirming and denying the devil's
existence. Ivan tells the devil he is only a hallucination---“It's I
myself, speaking, not you”---but does one address a hallucination? “You
don't exist” is surely a paradox. The devil doesn't mind this accusation
of nonbeing a bit. As if he had overheard the narrator's discussion of
Doubting Thomas, he remarks:

#quote(block: true)[
“Don't believe it then,” said the gentleman, smiling amicably, “what's
the good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are of no help
in believing. Especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because
he saw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw”
(#emph[BK];, 535).
]

The devil taunts Ivan with proofs that he is and at the same time isn't
a hallucination. He offers evidence for both possibilities. He also
points out that if one has to convince oneself that something is not
true, one must believe it at least to some degree. “From the vehemence
with which you deny my existence,” the devil laughs, “I am convinced you
believe in me,” if only a tiny bit, and, after all, “homeopathic doses
perhaps are the strongest” (#emph[BK];, 542). The devil explains that he
leads Ivan “to belief and disbelief by turns” because “hesitation,
suspense, conflict between belief and disbelief, is sometimes such
torture to a conscientious man, such as you are, that it's better to
hang oneself at once. #sym.dots.h It\'s the new method” (#emph[BK];, 542).
Ivan's “belief and disbelief” in morality is no less tormenting.

The devil himself claims to reside somewhere between existence and
nonexistence. Much as believing while disbelieving is a distinct state
of mind, “perhaps-being” is itself a way of being. If only he could
either be or not be, the devil pleads, how much better it would be!
“What I dream of is becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in
the form of some merchant's wife weighing two hundred and fifty pounds
and of believing all she believes. My ideal is to go to church and offer
a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is” (#emph[BK];, 537).
Appropriately enough, this devil is also an agnostic.

Faith, the devil leads Ivan to think, is firm and “simple-hearted,” not
hesitant and contradictory, but if Ivan really understood Zosima's
diagnosis he would realize that sometimes the search for faith can be a
kind of faith in itself. In T#emph[he Idiot];, Ippolit explains that
“Columbus was not happy when he had discovered America but while he was
discovering it. #sym.dots.h It's life that matters, nothing but life, the
everlasting and perpetual process, and not the goal at
all.”#footnote[Fyodor Dostoevsky, #emph[The Idiot];, trans. Constance
Garnett (New York: Modern Library, 1962), 375.] In #emph[A Writer's
Diary];, Dostoevsky explains that “happiness lies not in happiness but
only in the attempt to achieve it.”#footnote[Fyodor Dostoevsky, #emph[A
Writer's Diary: Volume One, 1873-1876];, trans. Kenneth H. Lantz
(Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1993), 335.] As happiness can be processual,
so can faith.

If Ivan would only realize the meaningfulness of questing, he would
resemble his creator. In his famous letter to Natalya Fonvizina, who was
suffering from depression, Dostoevsky consoled her that “at such moments
one thirsts for faith like ‘parched grass' #sym.dots.h  I will tell you that I
am a child of the \[materialist nineteenth\] century. A child of
disbelief and doubt. I am that today and (I know it) will remain so
until the grave. How much torture this thirst for faith has cost me and
costs me now, which is all the stronger in the soul for all the
arguments against it.”#footnote[I modify the translation of this letter
as it is cited in Joseph Frank, #emph[Dostoevsky: The Years of Ordeal,
1850-1859] (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983), 160.] Increase in disbelief
fuels increase in belief, as the search for faith grows ever more
intense.

Dostoevsky next affirms that, in this state of mind, he has formulated
his “credo”: nothing more beautiful than the image of Christ exists or
ever could exist. Of course, belief in the beauty of the image of Christ
does not necessarily entail belief in His existence. So Dostoevsky next
formulates his oft-quoted paradox: “Even more, if someone proved to me
that Christ is outside the truth, and that #emph[in reality] the truth
were outside Christ, then I should prefer to remain with Christ rather
than the truth.” But to believe in something is to believe it is true;
how can he believe in Christ lies outside the truth?

The answer is that faith as a striving for faith, faith as a process,
involves just such a paradox. Faith lies in the attempt to achieve it.

== Alyosha's Crisis

If Ivan suffers from extreme doubt, Alyosha is all too certain. The
incidents following the death of Father Zosima “exerted a very strong
influence on the heart and soul of #sym.dots.h Alyosha, forming a crisis and
turning point in his spiritual development, giving a shock to his
intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life”
(#emph[BK];,285). To strengthen his faith, Alyosha must first question
it.

Alyosha firmly expects the traditional sign that his mentor Father
Zosima was a saint, the incorruptibility of his body. He is more than
disappointed: not only does the elder's body not diffuse a sweet smell,
it emits the most pungent “odor of corruption” even more rapidly than
usual. All those who felt “jealousy of the dead man's saintliness” and
who out of jealousy had even succumbed “to an intense hatred of him,”
rejoice at his downfall. It seems to Alyosha that either there was no
miracle or, because the smell was “in excess of nature,” a reverse
miracle. Alyosha wonders resentfully, “Why did providence hide its face
‘at the most critical moment #sym.dots.h as though voluntarily submitting to
the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?” (#emph[BK];, 293).

Rakitin reports that Madame Khokhlakova wrote him a note saying “that
she would never have expected #emph[such conduct] from a man of such a
revered character as Father Zosima. ‘That was the very word she used:
conduct.'” The joke, of course, is that she treats the rapid decay of
Zosima's body as something he was choosing to do. But in a sense it is:
this is the action that Zosima would have chosen in order to teach
Alyosha not to place his faith in miracles.

The narrator comments: “If the question is asked: ‘Could all his grief
and disturbance have been due only to the fact that his elder's body had
shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing
miracles?' I must answer without beating about the bush, ‘Yes, it
certainly was'” (#emph[BK];, 292). Alyosha demands a miracle: that is
precisely what Christ refuses to do in his second temptation. As the
Inquisitor paraphrases it: “If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the
Son of God then cast thyself down, for it is written that the angels
shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself.” As fully human,
Jesus cannot be absolutely sure that he is who he thinks he is, but he
refuses to resolve doubt by demanding a miracle.

A miracle would eliminate uncertainty, but then people would simply be
acknowledging power, not demonstrating faith. As the Inquisitor
explains, “Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and did crave
faith freely given, not based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love
and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has
overawed him forever” (#emph[BK];, 222). Faith based on power that
precludes doubt is not faith at all because it is not “freely given,”
not a matter of choice; and choice can be real only when there is
uncertainty.

From the Inquisitor's point of view, certainty would make people
happier. Jesus therefore should have accepted the temptation and
performed a miracle, but He didn't. “Instead of giving a firm foundation
for serving the conscience of man at rest forever, Thou didst choose all
that is exceptional, vague, and enigmatic” (#emph[BK];, 223). And
instead of following clear and infallible rules, “man must hereafter
with free heart decide for himself what is good and evil, having only
Thy image before him as his guide.” An image inspires, but it does not
offer infallible prescriptions.

In demanding miracles, then, Alyosha misunderstands what faith is. He
experiences his “critical moment,” but in the next chapter, he recovers
faith by consoling Grushenka in #emph[her] “critical moment.” When
Alyosha returns to the monastery and listens to Father Paissy reading
the Gospel over Zosima's corpse, he dreams that Father Zosima has
praised this very act as truly Christian. The story Father Paissy reads,
the marriage at Cana, recounts Jesus's first miracle, which no one but
Jesus, Mary, and their servants detect. It is therefore a secret
miracle, one that does not call attention to itself. As Alyosha now
understands, that is also true of our loving kindness and compassion to
each other, which no rationalist theory could explain except as a sort
of bargain. Active, inconspicuous love is the true miracle.

When Madame Khokhlakova demands proof of God and immortality, Zosima
tells her that “there is no proving it” but that, if one lives the right
sort of life of active love, one can be convinced of it. The real
miracle is the one always available to us. One is convinced without
proof, and since love always flickers, doubt inevitably abides with
faith. The narrator refers to Alyosha as his “future hero” because he
plans to describe the many tests and temptations, doubts and renewals,
that Alyosha will undergo. His faith will always be a search for faith.

“Denying, believing and doubting are to men what running is to horses,”
observed Pascal, who, like Dostoevsky, considered why God did not give
indubitable proof of his existence (Pascal, 208). “If there were no
obscurity man would not feel his corruption: If there were no light man
could not hope for a cure,” Pascal explained. “Thus it is not only right
but useful for us that God should be partly concealed and partly
revealed” (Pascal, 167). That is why the atheist objection that “there
is nothing in the world which proves” God's existence misses the point.
God is, and must be, #emph[deus absconditus] \[the hidden God---Isaiah
45:15\].

Meditating on the death of his first wife, Dostoevsky recorded his
thoughts about life and faith as constant striving. The atheists object
that if Christianity is true, why does brotherhood not reign on earth?
Dostoevsky answers: because so long as man is on earth he lives in a
world of “struggle and development” and that life itself is always
“developing.” Humanity is always incomplete, always becoming itself, and
so “on earth man is in a transitory state.”#footnote[Fyodor Dostoevsky,
#emph[The Unpublished Dostoevsky: Diaries and Notebooks (1860-1881)];,
vol. 1, trans T. S. Berczynski, Barbara Heldt Monter, Arline Boyer, and
Ellendea Proffer (Ann Arbor: Ardis, 1973), 39. Further references are to
#emph[UD];.] People cannot completely fulfill the ideal of loving others
because it conflicts with “the law of #sym.dots.h personal identity. #sym.dots.h And
thus on earth mankind strives for an ideal opposed to his nature”
(#emph[UD];, 41).

Abiding in uncertainty and blending affirmation with doubt, faith
reflects our “transitory” nature. It is necessary “to develop, to
attain, to struggle, to glimpse the ideal through all one's falls and
eternally strive towards it”: that is what life on earth is (#emph[UD];,
39). What Ivan never comprehends, but Alyosha learns, is that one would
not so ardently seek faith if one had not already found it.
