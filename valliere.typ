The volume at hand is an introductory survey of Russian religious
philosophy designed for students of theology at the baccalaureate level.
The authors are a team of eleven scholars, including the general editor,
Konstantin M. Antonov, head of the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at St. Tikhon's Orthodox University for the Humanities
in Moscow. Most of the contributors are professionally trained
philosophers, and all but one are laypersons. The sections of the text
for which each contributor was responsible are identified in an
appendix.

In keeping with what Antonov calls “settled tradition” (14) in the study
of Russian religious philosophy, the subject matter is presented
historically rather than thematically. Chapter One describes the
“prehistory” of religious-philosophical ideas in Russia during the
period stretching from the eleventh through the eighteenth century.
Chapter Two deals with the gestation of a distinctive
religious-philosophical tradition in Russia from the 1820s through the
1870s. Chapter Three addresses the last quarter of the nineteenth
century, “the period of philosophical systems,” when Russian philosophy,
including religious philosophy, declared its (relative) independence
from the literary and journalistic contexts with which it was tightly
interwoven during the preceding period. The longest section in this
chapter---indeed, the longest section devoted to an individual thinker
in the entire volume---deals with Vladimir Soloviev (175--208). This
section was written by A. P. Kozyrev (Moscow State University).

Chapter Four presents the “religious-philosophical renaissance” of the
Russian Silver Age, a story that (in this volume) begins with the
Religious-Philosophical Meetings of 1901--1903 and ends with #emph[Iz
glubiny] (1918), the last of the three most important
religious-philosophical and socio-political #emph[sborniki] of the
Silver Age, the other two being #emph[Problemy idealizma] (1902) and
#emph[Vekhi] (1909). In this period, as our authors put it,
“religious-philosophical thought, extending its influence to \[Russian\]
culture as a whole, became a powerful instrument of desecularization, of
the return of religion to the public square, and of the return of a part
of the intelligentsia to the Church” (486).

Like V. V. Zenkovsky before them, the authors of this volume do not
neglect to discuss the study of philosophy in the theological academies
of the Russian Orthodox Church during the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. While “Russian religious philosophy” in the first instance
refers to pursuits that developed in the Russian intelligentsia apart
from ecclesiastical institutions, philosophers and other critical
thinkers were not lacking among the faculty of the Church's four
graduate theological academies (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kyiv, and
Kazan). The representatives of theological-academic thought discussed in
this volume are Fr. I. M. Skvortsov, Fr. F. A. Golubinskii, A. M.
Bukharev, Fr. F. F. Sidonskii, V. N. Karpov, Archbishop Nikanor
(Brovkovich), V. A. Snegirev, V. D. Kudriavtsev-Platonov, M. I.
Karinskii, A. I. Vvedenskii, S. S. Glagolev, M. M. Tareev, and V. I.
Nesmelov.

The longest chapter in the volume is the fifth and last: “Main
Tendencies and Leading Representatives of Twentieth Century Russian
Philosophy: Russian Religious Thought in the Emigration and in Soviet
Russia.” The unnatural division of Russian religious philosophy into
émigré and Soviet streams resulted, of course, from the tragedy of
Russian civilization in the twentieth century.

Among the thinkers who remained or came of age in Soviet Russia,
#emph[Russian Religious Philosophy] presents detailed portraits of only
two: Father Pavel Florensky and A. F. Losev. But our authors provide a
list of many other philosophers, scholars, and artists who managed,
under extremely difficult conditions, to engage with religious questions
in one way or another during the Soviet period (315--317). Some of these
figures are well known in the West (e.g., Bakhtin, Lotman, Averintsev),
but others are not (e.g., A. A. Meier, P. P. Pertsov, S. N. Durylin, M.
M. Prishvin). For Western scholars of Russian religious thought, the
roster of names on these pages serves as a kind of syllabus that can
lead us to a broader view of Russian religious thought as it pertains to
the Soviet period. Mikhail Epstein has already set a high standard for
work along these lines, but there is room for more.

Turning to the emigration, our authors classify the “greats” of
religious philosophy into three main schools of thought: the philosophy
of all-unity (S. N. Bulgakov, S. L. Frank, L. P. Karsavin); existential
personalism (N. A. Berdiaev, L. I. Shestov); and metaphysical
personalism (N. O. Losskii, S. A. Levitskii). Most of these figures had
achieved eminence already during the Silver Age. But a holistic
assessment of their accomplishments must include an account of the works
they produced in the emigration, works that were by no means a mere coda
to what came before. In addition to the “greats,” our authors treat a
number of younger émigré philosophers who do not fit into one of the
three main schools: B. P. Vysheslavtsev, V. V. Zenkovsky, I. A. Il'in,
G. P. Fedotov, and V. N. Il'in.

Almost all of the émigré religious philosophers showed a heightened
interest in Orthodox theology, even if most of them did not follow
Bulgakov's lead and become Orthodox theologians. There were practical as
well as psychological and intellectual factors involved in this shift.
Theological schools, ecclesiastical fellowships, engagement with the
Ecumenical Movement, and (in some cases) clerical vocations took the
place of the higher educational institutions and civil society networks
that supported Russian religious philosophy before the revolution. As
one would expect, the new context had the greatest impact on younger
émigrés who were still fashioning their careers. For the younger
generation, the options for professional development included: further
elaboration of ideas inherited from Silver Age thinkers (e.g., the
continuation of Novgorodtsev's legal-philosophical thought by I. A.
Il'in, N. N. Alekseev, and Vysheslavtsev); new departures in
socio-political thought (e.g., #emph[novogradstvo], Eurasianism);
interpreting Russian culture to Western audiences; more or less complete
assimilation into the Western philosophical tradition (e.g., Alexandre
Kojève, Alexandre Koyré, Isaiah Berlin), and finally, “switching over
wholly to theology (‘neopatristic synthesis,' personalism, eucharistic
ecclesiology, liturgical theology)---theology that for the most part
presented itself as opposed to the traditions of the ‘older' generation
(Archimandrite Sophrony Sakharov, Georges Florovsky, Vladimir Lossky,
Fr. Alexander Schmemann, Fr. John Meyendorff)” (315).

The last of the options just named---“switching over wholly to
theology”---refers to the rise of what is usually called “Neopatristic”
theology. A survey of the Neopatristic thinkers does not form part of
#emph[Russian Religious Philosophy]. From time to time, the authors draw
on some of Florovsky's inimitable characterizations of Russian thinkers
and cultural periods in #emph[Puti russkogo bogosloviia] (1937), but
Florovsky's theological ideas and those of his successors in the
Neopatristic movement fall outside the boundaries of this volume. The
reason is that our authors make a firm distinction between religious
philosophy and theology, enterprises that they hold to be mutually
relevant, but methodologically, conceptually, and professionally
independent (see pp. 17--19). In the Russian emigration, as our authors
believe, the pursuit of religious philosophy eventually came to an end:
“To sum up, we have to say that all the conditions \[of émigré
existence\] we have described produced a state of affairs in which
#emph[the continuation and further development of the tradition of
religious philosophizing in the emigration proved to be impossible. The
death of the leading representatives of this tradition brought it to a
halt]” (315, emphasis in the original). The Neopatristic movement, on
the other hand, set the course of Orthodox theology for the rest of the
twentieth century. Our authors do not argue that Russian religious
philosophy came to a halt #emph[because] of the Neopatristic movement.
It died out, in their view, because the “conditions” that supported it
ceased to exist. This reviewer would like to hear more about those
conditions, since it is certainly possible to imagine the
religious-philosophical tradition continuing and even flourishing in
changed circumstances, even if that outcome did not in fact materialize.

One way of construing the fate of Russian religious philosophy in the
emigration is to argue that the tradition found an afterlife in
Neopatristic theology. That is to say, the Neopatristic theologians,
despite their trenchant criticism of the Russian religious-philosophical
tradition, were more deeply indebted to it than they (and others)
realized. The best recent case for this view has been made by Paul L.
Gavrilyuk in #emph[Georges Florovsky and the Russian Religious
Renaissance] (2014). Although Gavrilyuk's work is not referenced in
#emph[Russian Religious Philosophy], the authors clearly agree with him
that the influence of Russian religious philosophy on modern Orthodox
theology has been enormous. In our volume's conclusion, we are presented
with a list of the religious philosophers' contributions to theology:

#quote(block: true)[
The reinterpretation of ecclesiology and the emergence of personalism in
anthropology initiated by Chaadaev and the Slavophiles; the
“confessionalization” of theological discourse and the idea of “the
Western captivity of Orthodox theology,” ideas that go back, again, to
the Slavophiles, and, closely associated with the idea of Western
captivity, the methodological rethinking of the foundations of
dogmatics; the emergence, beginning with Soloviev, of ecumenical
thought; beginning with Soloviev again, the emergence of the
sophiological project---controversial, yet attracting fresh attention in
our own day as a new way of thinking about the relationship between the
Creator and the creature, the Absolute and the relative; new forms of
eschatology and soteriology; the emergence, on the basis of the
Symbolist paradigm, of a theology of culture and a theology of the icon;
the impetus to the development of a theology of history, and more. From
the same perspective, we should examine the influence of religious
philosophy on the emergence of new theological movements: the
neopatristic synthesis, personalism, eucharistic ecclesiology,
liturgical theology, and more. Not one of these developments could have
taken place without the rethinking of foundations that we have pointed
out (490--491).

This long roster of contributions to theology leads to a conclusion with
which this reviewer and many other scholars of Russian thought will
heartily agree: “It is not surprising that the resonance of Russian
religious thought in the chorus of intellectual traditions throughout
the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first is not
weakening but growing. Not only Russian researchers but Western scholars
too are paying attention to the work of these religious thinkers, not
just as an object of study but as a source of inspiration” (491).

Throughout the book, our authors set a salutary example of
evenhandedness in the presentation of their material. They stick to
their primary mission, which is to tell the story of Russian religious
philosophy without telling readers what they should make of it. They let
the philosophers speak for themselves.

The scholarly apparatus is also exemplary. Eighty-five bibliographical
“commentaries” comprising almost forty pages of text (495--533) provide
an excellent guide for readers who wish to learn more about the thinkers
and topics surveyed. More specific documentation is supplied by no fewer
than 1110 footnotes---a large number for a volume of this kind, but
brevity and the absence of pedantry keep the notes from being
burdensome. A detailed table of contents and an index of names make for
easy navigation. Finally, the volume contains numerous illustrations,
including photographs and artist's sketches of the religious
philosophers and reproductions of masterpieces of modern Russian art at
the chapter divisions.

Konstantin Antonov and his team of authors are to be congratulated for
writing an excellent survey of the history of Russian religious
philosophy. Anyone who is looking for a comprehensive and reliable
introduction to the subject should begin with this book. Language is a
barrier, of course, but for scholars of Russia---in any discipline, not
just philosophy and religion---#emph[Russian Religious Philosophy] is a
gift that should not be overlooked.
